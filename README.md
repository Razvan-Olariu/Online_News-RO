# Online News Collector

# Who am I? :smile:
Hello! My name is Olariu Alexandru-Răzvan! I study Cybernetics at the Bucharest University of Economic Studies and I want to pursue a career in the domain of Cybersecurity! Since I was a little child I was very passionate about computers and IT. 

# What is this software? :computer:
*This software application is a total innovation in the romanian industry.*
*A newspaper collector, online, free and open-source.*
*It is made using Python 3.8.2 , Selenium and Requests.*

# :arrow_right: How does this work? :arrow_left:
* The software has 3 parts:*
* A web crawler, who crawls the newspaper website for information on a subject.*
* A web scraper, who scrapes the result of the crawler for future use by the GUI.*
* A Graphic User Interface, which is very in-depth and is the master of the crawler and scraper.*
* The web crawler and web scraper are python modules which I will upload into a single module, an API.*
* With the API, everyone will be able to develop better online newspaper collectors, as I like to call them.*
